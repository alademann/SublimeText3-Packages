Better JavaScript is now installed! To ensure that the updated syntax file and symbol list take
effect, you may need to do the following:

1. Close all open JavaScript/JSON files (including .sublime-settings files)
2. Exit Sublime
3. Delete the cache and index files in your Sublime user directory
4. Re-open Sublime


Uninstalling
------------
Before uninstalling Better JavaScript, be sure close all open JavaScript/JSON
files, and remove "JavaScript" from the "ignored_packages" list in your Sublime
user settings. You can now safely uninstall the Better JavaScript package.

It's normal to see a few errors from Sublime about not being able to find syntax files. Just exit
Sublime and re-open it, and everything should be fixed.
