TodoReview 2.0.0 (PREVIOUSLY SUBLIMETODO)
--------------------

Unfortunately, due to lack of time, the creator of SublimeTODO, @robcowie, is unable to maintain his package any longer. This is an extremely popular and useful plugin that needs an active maintainer and regular updates. @robcowie has allowed me to continue with his work, and hopefully I can both maintain and come up with some cool new features for everyone.

In this transition, the plugin is being renamed to TodoReview, to avoid any confusion.


This update is the initial release of TodoReview which includes the following:

- ST3 Support!
- Fixed Setting Issues
- Fixed Result Navigation Issues
- Added Color Scheme Support
- Added Preliminary Priorities Support
- Added Tag Support
- Modified search paths for eventual Sidebar Support
- Code Cleanup


This repo will be hosted at https://github.com/jonathandelgado/SublimeTodoReview. If you have any requests or issues, feel free to let me know.


Thank you @robcowie for all your work on this plugin in the first place.
