MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- Improve highlighting of doccomments
	- Highlight List and Map type (Thansk @plachat3)

	- Refactor analysis server code
	- Use generated api classes for the analysis server

	  The analysis server API is now generated from the API machine-readable
	  spec. This should make it easier to improve the integration with the
	  analysis server from now on.

	  The functionality provided by the analysis server should be considered
	  unstable and in alpha state at best, but you can get error checking
	  today by setting `dart_enable_experimental_editor_features` to `true`
	  in your Dart user settings.

	- Add missing import
