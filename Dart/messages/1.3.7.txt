Version 1.3.7

The Sublime Text Dart Package has been updated!

This version enables the analysis server for dart files outside of a pub package.

Since this is a such a small release, here's some trivia about the Dart plugin
for Sublime Text:

Dart is used to build development versions of the Dart plugin (Grinder), and
the Dart plugin is used to build Dart by the Dart Team. Having achieved full
recursion, Python must feel a bit jealous!

Please restart Sublime Text.
