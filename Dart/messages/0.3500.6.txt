MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- Add 'Dart: Show Output Panel' command palette item

	Reopens the output panel last used. For example, the one you see when
	running a server app via F7. This output panel can be easily hidden by
	accident by pressing Esc. This command provides the ability to show it
	again and check the progress.
