Version 1.2.0

The Sublime Text Dart Package has been updated!

This version adds integration with Stagehand. Stagehand helps you get up and
running with your new project by generating a project skeleton.

To use Stagehand:

1) Select "Dart: Stagehand" from the command palette
2) Select a template from the quick list (top)
3) Select a target directory from the input panel (bottom)

In (3), you can get file system completions by pressing "Tab" and "Shift+Tab".
The file system navigation panel provided also detects shell-like keys,
including Ctrl+a (go to BOL), Crl+e (go to EOL), Ctrl+f (move forward),
Ctrl+b (move backward), Ctrl+k (kill to EOL).

Please restart Sublime Text.
