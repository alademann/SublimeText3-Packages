MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- New build system for Dart files

	From the point of view of usage, you shouldn't notice much of a difference.

	However, F7 and Ctrl+F7 are now bound to a smarter build system. It will
	work on any pubspec.yaml file or .dart file. F7 will run the primary
	build action for the file (e. g. `pub get` for pubspec.yaml), and
	Ctrl+F7 will run the seondary action (e. g. show multiple actions in the
	case of pubspec.yaml).

	The existing build tasks to date will remain available through the
	command palette.

	Check the wiki for more information.

	- Never change the current build system automatically

	Should prevent annoyances if you're working with several programming
	languages in the same Sublime Text instance.
