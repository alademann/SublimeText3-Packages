Version 1.2.1

The Sublime Text Dart Package has been updated!

This version includes assorted fixes and small tweaks to existing funcionality.
However, major changes have been done under the hood. Notably, most supporting
code has been moved into its own library. If you experience any errors, please
report them.

Please restart Sublime Text.

MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- Dartfmt should not add extra lines
	- Add command to insert line terminator

	  	This command is disabled by default, but you can add assign it a key
	  	binding to insert missing ';' more conveniently at the end of the line.

	  	The command name is: insert_line_terminator

	- Fix #416 - always use /// for comments
	- Fix #418 - refactor supporting code into its own library
	- Run files under 'tests' as if they were scripts

		From now on, .dart files under the 'test' directory will be run as
		dart scripts. This should make it easier to run tests during development.
