Version 0.3500.7

The Sublime Text Dart Package has been updated!

This version includes bug fixes and some reorganization of commands in the
UI. Most notably, most commands formerly named 'Build: Dart: XXX' have been
renamed to 'Dart: XXX', as they did not really perform a build task.

Please restart Sublime Text.
