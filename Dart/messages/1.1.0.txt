Version 1.1.0

The Sublime Text Dart Package has been updated!

This version improves robustness of 'run' commands: it fixes existing bugs and
makes 'pub serve' use the next available port (instead of using the harcoded
8080 port).

Commenting-related commands have also been improved: the Markdown dialect
used in Dart comments should now be recognized thanks to a new (and minimal)
syntax definition for doc comments. At the same time, pressing return in any
commented out line should now continue the comment in the next line for all
styles of comments: double slash, triple slash (recommended) and block
comments.

Please restart Sublime Text.
