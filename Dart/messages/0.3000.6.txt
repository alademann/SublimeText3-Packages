MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- Add pub build task to command palette
	- Improve smart build system (F7/Ctrl+F7)

		* Detect and run files under 'example'
		* Ensure paths exist before using them
		The <root>/example and <root>/web directories should no longer be
		expected to exist and therefore cause intermittent exceptions.

	- Improve syntax def when using 'library' keyword
