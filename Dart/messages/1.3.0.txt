Version 1.3.0

The Sublime Text Dart Package has been updated!

This version includes initial integration with the analysis server available
in the SDK. The analysis server provides multiple language services for code
editors. In this release, the Sublime Text Dart plugin will run the server
in the background and display errors in the code. The analysis server is
enabled by default.

See the notes below for more details.

Please restart Sublime Text.
