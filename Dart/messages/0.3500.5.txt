MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- Add command palette item to run server apps through Observatory

	The new command 'Run In Observatory (Server Apps)' will only work with
	server apps and will launch the app and the attached Observatory instance
	in Dartium.

	Note: Web apps can always access the observatory via the Dev Tools pane
	in Dartium.
	
	- Bugfix: Don't call analysis server if unavailable
