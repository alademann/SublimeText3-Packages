Version 0.3500.13

The Sublime Text Dart Package has been updated!

This version modifies the 'run' commands: F7 ('Run' in command palette) will
now remember the file that was run last and use that subsequently. To update
the target file, use Ctrl+F7 or 'Run (This File)'. Ctrl+F7 and Ctrl+Shift+F7,
which perform a secondary action on a file, behave similarly.

Please restart Sublime Text.
