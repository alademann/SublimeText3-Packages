MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- Reinstate `dart_sdk_path` setting.

	Backwards-incompatible change.

	It is now again required to specificy the path to the Dart SDK as a
	Sublime Text setting. From now on, the Sublime Text Dart package will
	ignore you PATH. This is to avoid PATH visibility issues between instances
	of Sublime Text started from a command line vs instances started from the
	OS GUI. The reinstated setting should provide a better experience in both
	situations.

	Apologies about the inconvenience!


	- Make most settings global

	Backwards-incompatible change.

	Most settings controlling this package's behavior will now live in
	Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings. You can open this file using
	a built-in Sublime Text command from the command palette:
	'Preferences: Settings - User'.

	Additionally, all settings names have been unified to the form:

		dart_*

	Previously, there would be both dart_* and dartlint_* variants.

	Please check the documentation for more details.


	- Initial support for running polymer:new_element and polymer:new_entry

	It is now possible to generate Polymer elements from the command palette,
	and to add entry points to pubspec.yaml and generate the corresponding
	file, all from within Sublime Text.

	Note: At the moment, generated files will end up either under 'web' or
	a directory under it, depending on the path of the active file at the time
	of generating the Polymer files. This behavior will be made more flexible
	in the future.


	- Add basic configuration report

	Added a command to print basic configuration information for easy checking.
