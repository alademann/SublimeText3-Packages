MAIN CHANGES
------------

	- pub serve should run dart2js if it needs to (Thanks @sethladd)

	It's now possible to browse the launched web app via F7 in Dartium as well
	as in any other browser at the same time. F7 will serve both .dart code
	for Dartium and compiled .js code for other browsers.

	- Streamline settings

	Dart package settings have been consolidated in a 'Dart - Plugin Settings.sublime-settings'
	file. Your current settings should be copied to the new file automatically.
	You don't need to take any action. If you want to clean up the old settings
	file, make sure that the existing settings have been correctly copied to
	the new file and then edit `Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings`.
