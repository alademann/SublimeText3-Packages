#HTML5 snippets for Sublime Text

Add HTML5 syntax mode & snippets to Sublime Text.

### How to use the snippets

Instead of formal documentation, tab triggers for each HTML5 tag are the same as the tag, for example `time` expands to `<time datetime="${1:2011-01-12}">${2:January 12th, 2011}</time>` (where the `$1{...}` parts are editable placeholders once you have triggered the snippet). Please browse the repository to see what other snippets are included.

### Installation

Search for HTML5 on Package Control
