Sublime SFTP 1.3.0 Changelog:

** Backwards Compatibility Breaks **
 - Changed OS X key bindings to use Ctrl+Cmd instead of Cmd+Alt
 - The commands sftp_file and sftp_file_context were merged into a new command
   sftp_upload_file. Custom key bindings will need to be updated to reference
   this new command name.

New Features
 - Added the ability to download individual files
 - Added the ability to diff a file with the remote version
   - Diffs are generated and viewed in ST2 by default, but the diff_command
     setting may be used for an external diff viewer
 - Ignores .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, sftp-settings.json and desktop.ini by default 

Bug Fixes
 - Added support for SSH keys with passphrases on Windows when the key file is
   specified via the ssh_key_file setting
 - Improved Cancel command to work consistently, even if triggered in between
   two files being uploaded during a directory upload
 - Fixed a number of small errors that showed on the console
