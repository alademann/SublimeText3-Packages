Sublime SFTP 1.13.2 Changelog:


Bug Fixes
---------

 - Updated the bundled SSL module for ST3 on x64 Linux installs so that is does
   not require SSLv2 in libssl. Fixes compatibility with Ubuntu 13.10 x64.

 - Fixed a bug where users would get an error popup when opening some files.

 - Resolved an issue in ST3 where printing the remote file listing when it
   could not be parsed would result in an error.
