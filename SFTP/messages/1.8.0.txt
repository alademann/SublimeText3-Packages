Sublime SFTP 1.8.0 Changelog:

New Features

 - Added FTPS support

   Sublime Text does not include SSL support for Linux builds due to the
   different versions of OpenSSL. Linux users may enable experimental ftps
   support by opening Preferences > Package Settings > SFTP > Settings - User
   and setting "linux_enable_ssl": true.

   Once Sublime Text is restarted, Sublime SFTP will attempt to load one of
   several pre-compiled _ssl modules. The console will contain debug
   information. If for some reason Sublime is unstable with this enabled,
   please set "linux_enable_ssl": false and contact support@wbond.net for
   help in compiling a custom _ssl.so for Python 2.6.6. 


Bug Fixes

 - Fixed the SFTP > Map to Remote... menu entry in the editor context menu

 - Fixed parsing of directory listings with users or group names containing
   a space character
 
 - Improved compatibility with Filezilla Server
