Sublime SFTP 1.13.0 Changelog:


New Features
------------

 - Added an explicit setting "allow_config_upload" that must be set to true in
   order to upload any Sublime SFTP configuration file (primary or alternate).
   Previously this was handled by the default "ignore_regex" and
   "ignore_regexes" settings, however some users were deleting the ignore
   settings and then accidentally uploading their configurations to their web
   servers.

 - Non-routable private IP responses from FTP servers when in passive mode are
   now rewritten to use the original public hostname. The setting
   "ftp_obey_passive_host" was added to allow for (the very rare) situations
   where you want this to happen.

 - Added relative file path support for the "ssh_key_file" setting


Bug Fixes
---------
