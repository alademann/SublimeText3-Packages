Sublime SFTP 1.10.0 Changelog:

New Features

 - Added the "extra_list_connections" setting which allows spawning multiple
   connections to the server for vastly improved performance when determining
   files to be synced.

   This setting is set to the number of additional connections to open, and is
   ONLY used for the list operation that is perfomed when determining what files
   should be synced.

 - The "Chmod" operation is now available for files and folders when browsing a
   remote

 - Added the "keepalive" setting for users who experience frequent disconnects.

   This will send a command to the server every specified number of seconds in
   an effort to keep the connection open.

 - File ignoring is now slightly simpler - the "ignore_regex" setting has been
   deprecated, and replaced with "ignore_regexes", which is a list of smaller
   regular expressions. This should make adding file and folder paths easier.

 - Sync commands now perform file operations in a specific order for users that
   perform deployments via sync:

   1. Upload/download new files
   2. Upload/download existing files
   3. Remove old files

 - Added a new version of psftp.exe on Windows that supports the -s flag via
   "sftp_flags" to allow a custom subsystem to be specified

 - Changed SFTP connections on OS X and Linux to use compression by default for
   better performance

 - The ignore regex patterns are now checked against both Linux/OS X and
   Windows style file and folder paths so users may more easily write ignore
   rules that must work across different operating systems


Bug Fixes

 - Added multiple new file listing formats, including support for IIS FTP v7.5
   and IIS servers that respond with four digit years

 - Tweaked the delay of performing the "sync_down_on_open" feature on OS X in
   order to ensure that it happens. Also added a new editor-wide setting
   called "osx_sync_down_on_open_delay" that allows tweaking the delay for
   users still experiencing issues.

 - Fixed an issue where in specific situations the root folder of a sync would
   be listed twice when using the FTP protocol

 - Added error handling for encoding errors

 - Fixed an issue on OS X where an sftp-config.json file in a folder with a
   non-ASCII character would cause mapping to be broken, and the remote path
   to be the same as the local path

 - Added error handling for errors when checking symlinks on certain FTP servers

 - Added trapping for multiple errors related to re-opening Sublime with a
   remote file after the local operating system and wiped the temp directory

 - Added checks for remote files that were opened on a copy of Sublime Text
   that has been synced between two different machines (such as via Dropbox)
   where temp folders are incompatible (e.g. Windows vs Linux/OS X)

 - Fixed a bug with NotFoundErrors when trying to reset the local working
   directory after a remote operation

 - Fixed an error with downloading a symlinked file when
   "preserve_modiciation_times" is set to true
 
 - Added another FTP passive mode error handler condition

 - Resolved a working directory (pwd) error caused by the Tornado-vxWorks fix
   from v1.9.7

 - Added a check for disk full messages

 - Added support for a new (previously unreported) FTP password prompt

 - The "sftp_flags" setting now accepts a list by default instead of a string
