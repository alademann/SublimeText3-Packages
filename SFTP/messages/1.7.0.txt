Sublime SFTP 1.7.0 Changelog:

Please be sure to restart Sublime Text 2 to start using this new version.

** Backwards Compatibility Breaks **

 - Newly created remote configs will be called sftp-config.json instead of
   sftp-settings.json. You may need to update your VCS ignore settings.
   Existing sftp-settings.json files will continue to function.

 - The sftp_remotes folder in the Packages/User/ folder has been renamed to
   sftp_servers. You may need to update your VCS ignore settings.

 - The following commands were renamed:
     sftp_browse_remote -> sftp_browse_server
     sftp_edit_remote   -> sftp_edit_server
     sftp_delete_remote -> sftp_delete_server
   Custom key bindings may need to be updated.

New Features

 - Added sync_down_on_open setting that will prompt to download the remote
   version of a file when opening a file, if the remote version is newer.

 - Added confirm_overwrite_newer setting that will prompt if the file being
   uploaded is older than the file on the server. This only affects single
   file uploads and causes uploads to be a little slower since a remote
   file listing is required on each upload.
 
 - Added Monitor File command that will periodically check file modification
   time and upload the file if it changes. This is intended to work with
   programs such as CodeKit and CSS compilers that will modify a
   file externally to Sublime. Frequency of checks can be controlled via
   SFTP settings.

 - Added preserve_modification_times setting to preserve the modification time
   of files when uploading and downloading. This does not work on all servers.
   The plugin will notify if a server is incompatible. Can be set to
   "download_only" if remote/server does not support it.

 - Added password prompting with asterisk password hiding, eliminating the
   requirement of saving passwords

 - Added context menu entry to delete the remote version of a file

 - Added context menu entry to rename the local and remote versions of a file

 - Default remote/server configuration can now be edited by copying the file
   Packages/SFTP/SFTP.default-config to Packages/User/ and customizing

 - Restructured the menus to have a single entry labelled SFTP/FTP in
   the file menu, side bar content menu and editor context menu

 - Changed Windows to use Sublime Text interface for SSH key passphrase
   entry instead of Pageant

 - Improved performance of reconnecting after a disconnect when the
   remote_time_offset_in_hours setting is not set

 - Added uncaught exception handling to help debugging unreported errors

Bug Fixes

 - Added checks for required configuration information to prevent
   silent failures

 - Fixed a bug with deleting remote folders that would cause a not found error

 - Added a missing Upload Folder entry to the side bar context menu

 - Now properly parses MS FTP server file listings that include file
   names with spaces

 - Fixed a crash on some OS X machines when using upload_on_save or
   editing remote files

 - Changed passphrase prompting on Windows to not disappear after one second

 - Activity indicator in status area is properly cleared after uploading a
   file via its preview

 - Fixed sync commands to function properly when syncing a single file and
   perform only a single file listing when syncing a single file

 - Fixed a bug with sync operations disconnecting while listing local files
   for SFTP remote with short idle timeout and many local folders

 - Updated plugin to ignore .DS_Store, desktop.ini and Thumbs.db files in
   the Packages/User/sftp_servers folder to prevent parsing errors
