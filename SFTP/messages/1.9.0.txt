Sublime SFTP 1.9.0 Changelog:

New Features

 - Added support for multiple remote configurations and switching them

   New menu items were added to the side bar and editor context menus and the
   command palette to Add Alternate Remote Mapping... and Switch Remote
   Mapping...

   This functionality is intended for users who need to upload from the same
   local folder to multiple remote environments. It is not possible, however,
   to upload to multiple environments simultaneously - the remote mapping must
   be switched and the files/folders uploaded to each in turn.

 - Added the Delete Local and Remote Files/Folders menu entries to the side bar
   and editor context menus and the command palette

 - Added confirm_downloads option to sftp-config.json files

 - Fixed the sync_down_on_open setting to obey the ignore_regex setting

 - Fixed a bug with FTP disconnections sometimes causing crashes on OS X

 - Added the cs_CZ2 remote_locale for servers using slightly different Czech
   month name abbreviations 
 
 - Fixed handling of files and folder names that consist only of a space, or
   that end with a space

 - Corrected a bug where a connection error while performing a sync would
   causes an error popup

 - Removed some debugging information that was being printed to the console
   when connecting to MS FTP servers
 
 - Fixed FTPS connections to fallback to cleartext mode for data transfers when
   the remote server rejects the encrypted mode command
