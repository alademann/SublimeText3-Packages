Sublime Text 2/3 Markdown Preview
=================================

Preview and build your markdown files quickly in your web browser from sublime text 2/3. 

You can use builtin [python-markdown][10] parser or use the [github markdown API][5] for the conversion.

**NOTE:** If you choose the GitHub API for conversion (set parser: github in your settings), your code will be sent through https to github for live conversion. You'll have [Github flavored markdown][6], syntax highlighting and EMOJI support for free :heart: :octocat: :gift:. If you make more than 60 calls a day, be sure to set your GitHub API key in the settings :). You can also get most of this in the default Markdown parser with by enabling certain extensions; see "[Parsing Github Flavored Markdown](#parsing-github-flavored-markdown)"" below for more information.

**LINUX users:** If you want to use GitHub API for conversion, you'll need to have a custom Python install that includes python-ssl as its not built in the Sublime Text 2 Linux package. see [@dusteye comment][8]. If you use a custom window manager, also be sure to set a `BROWSER` environment variable. see [@PPvG comments][9]

## Features :

 - Markdown preview using the [Python-markdown][10] or the Github API just choose select the build commands.
 - Syntax highlighting via Pygments. See "[Configuring Pygments](#configuring-pygments)" for more info.
 - Build markdown file using Sublime Text build system. The build parser are config via the `"parser"` config.
 - Browser preview auto reload on save if you have the [ST2 LiveReload plugin][7] installed.
 - Builtin parser : supports `abbr`, `attr_list`, `def_list`, `fenced_code`, `footnotes`, `tables`, `smart_strong`, `smarty`,  `wikilinks`, `meta`, `sane_lists`, `codehilite`, `nl2br`, and `toc` markdown extensions.
 - CSS search path for local and build-in CSS files (always enabled) and/or CSS overriding if you need
 - YAML support thanks to @tommi
 - Clipboard selection and copy to clipboard thanks to @hexatrope
 - MathJax support : \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\) thanks to @bps10
 - HTML template customisation thanks to @hozaka
 - Embed images as base64 (see [settings][settings] file for more info)
 - Strip out multimarkdown critic marks (see [settings][settings] file for more info)
 - 3rd party extensions for the Python Markdown parser:
 	- **magiclink**: Automatic conversion of http or ftp links to html links.
 	- **delete**: Surround inline text with double `~~word~~` show text ~~crossed out~~.
 	- **tasklist**: Support for github like tasklists using the following notation: `- [X] Completed Task`.
 	- **githubemoji**: Support for github emojis (`:smile:` --> :smile:). Converts to HTML images that use github's actual emoji assets.
 	- **b64**: Convert and embed images in the HTML as base64 by adding the extension as `b64(base_path=${BASE_PATH})` (recently a global b64 that works on all parsers was added; see [settings][settings] file for more info).
 	- **headeranchor**: Adds support for github style anchor links preceding headers.
 	- **github**: A convenience extension to add: `magiclink`, `delete`, `tasklist`, `githubemoji`, `headeranchor`, and `nl2br` to parse and display GFM in a github-ish way.  It is recommed to pair `github` with `extra` and `codehilite` (with language guessing off) to parse close to github's way.

## Installation :

### Using [Package Control][3] (*Recommended*)

For all Sublime Text 2/3 users we recommend install via [Package Control][3].

1. [Install][11] Package Control if you haven't yet.
2. Use `cmd+shift+P` then `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Look for `Markdown Preview` and install it.

### Manual Install

1. Click the `Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦` menu
2. Browse up a folder and then into the `Installed Packages/` folder
3. Download [zip package][12] rename it to `Markdown Preview.sublime-package` and copy it into the `Installed Packages/` directory
4. Restart Sublime Text

## Usage :

### To preview :

 - optionally select some of your markdown for conversion
 - use `cmd+shift+P` then `Markdown Preview` to show the follow commands (you will be prompted to select which parser you prefer):
	- Markdown Preview: Preview in Browser
	- Markdown Preview: Export HTML in Sublime Text
	- Markdown Preview: Copy to Clipboard
	- Markdown Preview: Open Markdown Cheat sheet
 - or bind some key in your user key binding, using a line like this one:
   `{ "keys": ["alt+m"], "command": "markdown_preview", "args": {"target": "browser", "parser":"markdown"} },` for a specific parser and target or `{ "keys": ["alt+m"], "command": "markdown_preview_select", "args": {"target": "browser"} },` to bring up the quick panel to select enabled parsers for a given target.
 - once converted a first time, the output HTML will be updated on each file save (with LiveReload plugin)

### To build :

 - Just use `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux) or `cmd+B` (Mac) to build current file.

### To config :

Using Sublime Text menu: `Preferences`->`Package Settings`->`Markdown Preview`

- `Settings - User` is where you change your settings for Markdown Preview.
- `Settings - Default` is a good reference with detailed descriptions for each setting.

### Configuring Pygments
If you add the codehilite extension manually in the enabled extensions, you can override some of the default settings.

* Turn language guessing *on* or *off* (*on* will highlight fenced blocks even if you don't specify a language)  `codehilite(guess_lang=False)` (True|False).
* Show line numbers: `codehilite(linenums=True)` (True|False).
* Change the higlight theme: `codehilite(pygments_style=emacs)`.
* Inline the CSS: `codehilite(noclasses=True)` (True|False).

See [codehilte page](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/code_hilite.html) for more info.

### Parsing Github Flavored Markdown :
Github Flavored Mardown (GFM) is a very popular markdown.  Markdown Preview can actually handle them in a couple of ways: online and offline.

#### Online :
Parsing GFM using the online method requires using the Github API as the parser.  It may also require setting `github_mode` to `gfm` to get things like tasklists to render properly.

#### Offline :
By default almost all extensions are enabled to help with the github feel, but there are some tweaks needed to get the full experience.

GFM does not auto guess language in fenced blocks, but Markdown Preview does this by default.  You can fix this in one of two ways:

1. Disable auto language guessing in the settings file `"guess_language": false,`
2. Or if you are manually defining extensions: `"enabled_extensions": ["codehilite(guess_lang=False,pygments_style=github)"]`


As mentioned earlier, almost all extensions are enabled by default, but as a reference, the minimum extensions that should be enabled are listed below:

```javascript
	"enabled_extensions": [
		"extra",
		"github",
		"codehilite(guess_lang=False,pygments_style=github)"
	]
```

This may be further enhanced in the future.
