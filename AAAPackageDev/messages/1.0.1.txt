===============================================================================
AAAPackageDev received quite a few changes and is finally compatible with
Sublime Text 3!
===============================================================================


The latest update is mostly ST3-compatibility, but because of technical issues
the update news from the last update about 4 months ago has never been shown.
Thus, the changelog from back then is included in this update notice. If you
just want to read the current changes, see
https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev/pull/38.


~ Reworked file conversion (plist <-> json) completely and added YAML to form
  a "triangle". The Build system has been renamed to "Convert to ...".

  It is recommended you check out the updated guide on
  http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-2/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html
  or just take a look at a sample file:
  https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev/blob/6dcb22151c99ede162460c3a54ea0ae69a07fb09/Syntax%20Definitions/Sublime%20Text%20Syntax%20Def%20%28YAML%29.YAML-tmLanguage

+ Added syntax definition and dynamic completions for YAML syntax definitions

  The syntax highlight for YAML-tmLanguage files might still have some
  problems because YAML is not easy to parse with regular expressions. Please
  open an issue with an example for when the highlighting breaks or does not
  work as intended.

+ Added `rearrange_yaml_syntax_def` command that rearranges and sorts YAML
  syntax definitions sanely ("z:AAAPackageDev: Convert to YAML and Rearrange
  Syntax Definition")

~ JavaScript-like comments are recognized and ignored when converting.

~ Revamp Raw Snippets highlighting

+ JSON syntax definitions now support the "@" symbol in goto anything (as well
  as YAML) and highlights JavaScript-like comments, which can also be toggled
+ Added comment toggling for keymaps
* Fixed #19 and made parsing plists work on certain Linux distributions by
  using another plist parsing lib
* Fixed highlighting of comments within sublime settings arrays
* Fixed #15: Weird highlighting of build variants
* Highlight `null` in sublime settings

and more ...
